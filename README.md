# Subway_Maps

This project uses Graph Theory to create a simulation of what Modern Subway Systems consist of. It is a Graph made of vertexes (stations) connected by edges (lines) to create a connected Subway System.
It uses techniques in Graph Theory such as Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Tarjan's Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components and Dijkstra's Algorithm. All these algorithms tackles things like Shortest Path, Critical Connections(connections which when removed, will split the grpah into 2), Finding Groups of vertexes and finally the cost of traversing from point a to b.
Modern Subway Systems use multiple parallel edges differentiated by cost or color to project the differences in routes. This project implements exactly that. It is modeled after or has the London Undeground in mind when creating the entire Map.
The Model map which i had created to simulate some of the stations and lines in the Map are included in this project, named "SubwayMap.pdf". It can be used to create a Subway System and Testing Purposes.
